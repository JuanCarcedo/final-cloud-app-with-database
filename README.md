## IBM Skills Network - Intro to the project
The starting point of this project can be found here [IBM Project](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/final-cloud-app-with-database). This is a fork.  
The main point of this project is to replicate what I would do in a client/new project enhancing an app in Django.  
The scope of this repository is to include an exam capability for the online courses; including:
+ Questions with multiple choices (one or more correct).  
+ The user can see and take the exam only if it is enrolled in the course.
+ The user can submit as many exams as desired.
+ The user will be able to check the correct answers and will receive a proper message once the exam is submitted (pass, failed).

### Changes from original forked version
- I installed in my venv newer versions of the packages than the ones required.
- Re-using html codes:
  - I changed all templates/html to use {% include 'HTML.html' %} and {% block content %} / {% endblock %}. I think this is a better way to "handle" all html files.
- If a user is not authenticated, it will be possible to check the Course contents instead of seing "Enroll" as option.
- Minor bug fixed (suggested text is now relevant).

## Instructions
### How to install:  
- Fork the project.
- Configure GitBash:
  - `git config --global user.email "myemail@something.com"`
  - `git config --global user.name "MyUser"`
- Local clone `git clone <URL_PROJECT>` of the project in your local machine.
- Open your favourite IDE (I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)).
- Create a virtual environment (I am using Python 3.11).
- Install required packages using `py -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt`
- Remember to Commit and Push changes to your GitHub!

### Version Updates:
